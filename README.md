  Part 2, look at data from the Framingham Heart Study, an observational study into cardiovascular health.

  Part 3, examine the effect that hormone replacement therapy has on the risk of coronary heart disease for post-menopausal women using data from the Nurses'         Heart Study and Heart and Estrogen-Progestin Replacement Study.

  Part 4, explore the effect that the consumption of saturated fats has on cardiovascular death rates using data from the National Heart-Diet Study
